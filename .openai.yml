      The goal of the game is to effective use the reward provided
        in order to understand the best action to take.

        After each step the agent receives an observation of:
        0 - No guess yet submitted (only after reset)
        1 - Guess is lower than the target
        2 - Guess is equal to the target
        3 - Guess is higher than the target

        The rewards is calculated as:
        ((min(action, self.number) + self.bounds) / (max(action, self.number) + self.bounds)) ** 2
        This is essentially the squared percentage of the way the
        agent has guessed toward the target.

        Ideally an agent will be able to recognise the 'scent' of a
        higher reward and increase the rate in which is guesses in that
        direction until the reward reaches its maximum.

      The goal of the game is to guess within 1% of the randomly
        chosen number within 200 time steps

        After each step the agent is provided with one of four possible
        observations which indicate where the guess is in relation to
        the randomly chosen number

        0 - No guess yet submitted (only after reset)
        1 - Guess is lower than the target
        2 - Guess is equal to the target
        3 - Guess is higher than the target

        The rewards are:
        0 if the agent's guess is outside of 1% of the target
        1 if the agent's guess is inside 1% of the target

        The episode terminates after the agent guesses within 1% of
        the target or 200 steps have been taken

        The agent will need to use a memory of previously submitted
        actions and observations in order to efficiently explore
        the available actions.
